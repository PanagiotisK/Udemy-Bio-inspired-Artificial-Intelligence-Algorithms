Dendrites       - recieve data from other neurons

Cell Body    - processes data

Axon            - transmits signals to other neurons using Axon terminals

Synapse         -  complete transmission of information (electrical signals)

---

In biology, when a Synapse occurs chemical substances are released by neurons 
and these chemical substances enter the Dendrites, increasing or decreasing the electrical potential
of the cell body, so the informational process in a biological neuron is given by the electrical potential
which will then leads to decision making.
